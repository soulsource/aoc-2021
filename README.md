# aoc-2021
My advent of code solutions. Might be good, might be bad. Might depend on other repos (of myself) on github.

For instance, day6 requires the boxed_array_ringbuffer.

# SPOILER!

Beware, if you haven't solved those riddles yourself, the source files are obvious spoilers.

# Noteable solutions:
- Day6 has a floating-point closed-form solution that might be interesting. Details are outlined in comments in the source code. I won't write them here to avoid spoilers.
- Day7 has solutions that are way smarter than brute-force, and are also really short. The derivation of those solutions is in the comments in the source code.
